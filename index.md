## Print()

### NAME

print() - Sansevieria, commonly known as Snake plant or Mother-in-Law's Tongue.

### SYNOPSIS

print() [WATER] [SUNLIGHT] [LOVE]

### DESCRIPTION

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hi! Thanks for taking care of print(). Print() (print-parent-parent)  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is a snake plant that we got from IKEA and is a common house plant   
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;known for its "air-purifying" features. We named it print() because   
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;it is a snake plant and python is a snake and print() is one defining   
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;features of python.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Snake plants are very low maintenance (the reason why we decided to   
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;bring it home). 

### OPTIONS

-w, \-\-water

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;research has shown a watering of anytime between weekly to bimonthly  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is okay as long as the dirt is dry. Water from bottom of pot, if  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;possible. Warning is to not over water. You do not need to water.  
  
-s, \-\-sunlight

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;bright, indirect light is preferred. However, for slower growth put  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in a shady or low-light area. You may place in any convinent area  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that isn't the trash.  
  
-l, \-\-love

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;these guys are pretty sturdy so wiping down the dust from the leaves  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;with a moist cloth to allow more photosynthesis would be great but  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;not required. You may sing and read poems to print(), I think it  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;might even enjoy it.
